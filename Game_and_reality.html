  [메타버스 이미 시작된 미래 272p] The future is already here - it's just not very evently distributed. - William Gibson
  <br><br>

  <a></a>
  [메타버스 이미 시작된 미래 27p] 이렇듯 '메타버스'란 용어를 세상에 다시 불러들인 건 엔비디아의 젠슨 황이다. "메타버스의 시대가 오고 있다"는 그의 말은 1962년 캐네디 대통령의 연설인 "우리는 달에 가기로 결정했습니다"와 같이 새로운 시대를 여는 시작점으로 기억될 수 있을 것이다.
  <br><br>

  <a></a>
  [메타버스 328-329p] 대부분 메타버스의 시스템은 벌금, 처벌, 비난 등의 '빼기'가 아닌 상금, 레벨업, 축하 등의 '더하기'로 설계되어 있습니다. 그래서 우리는 그 세계의 상호작용을 좋아합니다. 빼기 구조인 현실 세계를 더하기로 바꾸는 게 좋을까요? 아니면 현실 세계의 구조와 비슷하게 메타버스 세계를 빼기로 바꾸는 게 좋을까요? 빼기가 싫어서 더하기를 찾아 도피를 했다고 보기에는 현실 세계에 지나치게 많은 빼기가 있습니다. 사람들은 더하기가 많은 메타버스 세계에서 더 많은 도전을 꿈꿉니다. 빼기보다는 더하기를 중심으로 탐험하고, 소통하고, 성취하고자 합니다.<br>
  현실 세계에서 무언가 실패하면, 실패에 따라오는 빼기가 우리를 깊은 좌절에 빠지게 하는 경우가 많습니다. 진행하던 프로젝트를 망치거나 낮은 성적을 받으면, 보너스가 깎이거나 부모님이 던지는 비난을 견뎌야 합니다. 반면에 메타버스에서는 무언가를 실패해도 빼기를 하지 않습니다. 오히려 한 번 더 해보라고 부추깁니다. 그 상황에서 실패에 대한 경험은 우리에게 오히려 더 강력한 도전 동기를 제공합니다. 이를 좌절 효과(frustration effect)라 합니다. 현실 세계와 메타버스, 이 둘 모두는 우리에게 좌절 효과를 불러일이키는 도전의 세계여야 합니다.
  <br><br>

  <a></a>
  [메타버스 238-239p] 독일의 시인이자 극작가 프리드리히 본 실러는 '인간의 미적 교육에 관한 편지'에서 이런 얘기를 했습니다. 인간은 여러 가지 육체적, 물질적 욕망과 이성적, 도덕적 욕망을 동시에 가진 존재인데, 우리에게 잠재된 놀이 충동이 이 둘을 조화시킨다고 했습니다. 인간은 놀이를 통해 자유로워지며, 아름다운 존재가 됩니다. 자유와 아름다움을 깨달은 인간만이 참된 목적을 추구할 수 있습니다. 또한, 철학자 칸트는 놀이가 즐겁고 편한 이유는 아무런 목적이 없기 때문이라 했습니다. 가상 세계 메타버스에서 우리 아이들이 목적 없이 편하게 놀도록 곁에서 지켜봐주시고, 어른들도 함께 목적 없이 놀면 좋겠습니다. 그러다 보면 우리는 자유롭고 아름다운 인간이 추구해야 할 목적을 더 찾아낼 것입니다.
  <br><br>

  <a></a>
  [메타버스 230p] 인간의 뇌는 크게 세 가지 감정을 추구합니다. 세 가지 감정은 지배, 자극, 균형입니다.(뇌, 욕망의 비밀을 풀다 - 출처 표시 안함) 지배는 경쟁에서 이기거나 누군가를 물리치는 행동, 남에게 무언가를 지시하는 행동에서 느끼는 만족감입니다. 자극은 새로운 음악, 명상을 즐기거나 낯선 곳으로 여행을 가는 경험, 새로운 사람을 사귀는 만남 등에서 얻는 탐색, 발견과 관련된 감정입니다. 균형은 안정감을 유지하고 싶은 감정입니다. 위험한 상황, 무서운 것, 불확실한 조건 등을 피하고 싶은 마음입니다.<br>
  단순히 보면 우리가 메타버스에 올라타는 이유는 이런 세 가지ㅏ 감정 중 일부 또는 전체를 현실 세계에서 충분히 느끼지 못하고 잇기 때문입니다.
  <br><br>

  <a></a>
  [메타버스 214p] 가상 세계에 머무는 이가 아이이건 어른이건, 이유는 비슷합니다. 현실에서 느끼는 탐험, 소통, 성취의 기쁨이 질 또는 양적인 측면에서 어딘가 부족하여 갈증을 느끼기 때문입니다.
  <br><br>

  <a></a>
  [메타버스 103p] 좋은 일에 칭찬을 듣고, 나쁜 일에 위로를 받고 싶은 자연스러운 마음을 너무 억누르지 않으면 좋겠습니다. 외적인 보상, 자극 또는 타인과의 소통 없이 스스로 다독이는 능력도 중요하지만, 하루도 평온하지 않은 21세기를 살아가는 우리에게는 더 큰 인내력보다 좀 더 충분한 칭찬과 위로가 필요하지 않을까 생각합니다.
  <br><br>

  <a></a>
  [메타버스 71p] 증강현실이라고 해서 꼭 렌즈, 스마트폰 앱 같은 하이테크를 동원하지 않아도 됩니다. 중요한 것은 어떻게 하면 현실에 무언가를 덧씌워서 사람들의 감각, 경험, 생각을 증강하거나 다른 곳으로 이끌 수 있는가입니다.(중략) 증강현실 메타버스가 현실 세계의 규칙, 법을 그대로 따르지 않아도 괜찮습니다. 현실의 규칙, 법에 반하더라도 증강현실 메타버스 세상 속 구성원 모두에게 득이 되도록 작동하면 됩니다. 다만, 증강현실 메타버스 속에서 벌어진 일들이 현실 세계에 피해를 주지 않으면 됩니다.
  <br><br>

  <a></a>
  [메타버스 66p] 메타버스 구현에 과학, 공학적 요소가 필요하기는 합니다. 그러나 코카콜라가 만들어낸 메타버스를 볼 때 과학, 공학적 요소가 메타버스의 전부가 아님을 잊지 말아야 합니다. 인문학적 감수성과 철학이 담겨있지 않다면 증강현실 메타버스는 단순히 신기술의 전시장이 될 뿐입니다.

    <h3>[The world this week - Politics]</h3>

    Donald Trump signed an executive order ending Hong Kong's privileged trading status with America, in response to China's imposition of a crushing national-security law. Under new legislation, banks aiding officials who implement the law may face sanctions, as may the officials.<br><br>

    Separately, China announced sanctions against American officials, including Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz, two Republican senators. The move was in retaliation against American officials, including Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz, two Republican senators. The move was in retaliation against American penalties on Chinese politicians for abusing the human rights of China's Uighur citizens.<br><br>

    Jeff Sessions was clobbered in Alabama's Republican Senate primary by Tommy Tuberville. Mr Sessions, a senator for 20 years until 2017, was an early supporter of Donald Trump, who made him attorney-general. His decision to recuse himself from investigations into Russian interference in the 2016 election made the president turn on him.<br><br>

    Chinese officials accused pro-democracy politicians in Hong Kong of harbouring "evil intentions" by staging informal primary elections in preparation for Legislative Council polls in September. They said the democrats wanted to turn Hong Kong into a base for "subversion"--a crime under the new national-security law.<br><br>

    Floods continued to cause massive disruption across central and southern China. The deluges have killed more than 140 people, destroyed about 28,000 homes and caused more than $11bn-worth of damage.<br><br>

    China accused America of stoking tensions in the South ChinaSea by declaring that China's claims there are "completely unlawful".<br><br>

    Brazil's space agency, INPE, reported that 3,069 square kilometres(1,185 square miles) of the Amazon was cut or burned down from January to June, an increase of 25% from the same period last year. After the announcement, the head of the department responsible for monitoring deforestation was moved to another job. Last ear the government sacked INPE's chief after the agency reported an increase in deforestation.<br><br>

    Martin Vizcarra, Peru's president, replaced more than half of his cabinet after his approval ratings fell. Pedro Cateriano, a previous prime minister, has taken the job again. The recession caused by teh pandemic has led Mr Vizcarra's popularity to drop from 87% in March to a still-impressive 65%.<br><br>

    Poland's president, Andrzej Duda, was narrowly re-elected, surviving a fierce challenge from the mayor of Warsaw. Mr Duda's campaign involved deriding gay people and Jews.<br><br>

    Protests erupted across Belarus after opposition candidates were barred from standing in next month's presidential election. Meanwhile in Khabarovsk, in Russia's Far East, crowds demonstrated after the local governor was arrested on a 15-year-old murder allegation. Protesters said his real crime was being more popular than the president, Vladimir Putin.<br><br>

China, though, is forecast to grow by 1%.<br><br>

    Andrew Bailey, the governor of the Bank of England, said that he  doesn't want its bond-buying programme to become a "permanent feature" of the British economy. In a shift of policy from his  predecessor, Mark Carney, Mr Bailey indicated that it "would be better to consider adjusting the level of reserves first" before raising interest rates. The central bank recently increased its quantitative-easing programme by $125bn.<br><br>

    The pentagon released a list of 20 companies and  state-controlled enterprises it believes are owned or supported  by the Chinese army. The publication of the list, which includes Huawei, is mostly symbolic. Congress required the Pentagon to catalogue entities with ties to China's armed forces in 1999, but no document had ever been made public before.<br><br>

    Wirecard, a German digital payments company, filed for insolvency after Markus Braun, its chief executive, was arrested to answer allegations of fraud. The company has admitted that $2.1bn held on its balance-sheet probably does not exist. In what is one of Europe's biggest accounting scandals in recent years, Wirecard acknowledged the money was phantom after two banks in the Philippines where it supposedly had been deposited denied having ever received it.<br><br>

    Bayer agreed to pay up to $10.9bn to settle claims that its Roundup weedkiller causes cancer. The German drugs and chemicals company inherited the claims when it bought Monsanto, Roundup's maker, in 2018. It might have to make further payouts to those plaintiffs who are refusing to settle.<br><br>

    Apple said it would start offering desktop and laptop computers powered by chips designed in-house, rather than those from Intel, its current supplier. The chips, derived from designs by ARM, which is based in Britain, will be similar to those that already power its smartphones and tablets. Apple hopes that the ability to run software across multiple devices might boost sales of its Mac computers.<br><br>

    Brazil's central bank blocked Facebook's digital-payments service on WhatsApp because it had yet to complete its analysis of the implications. WhatsApp Pay was launched in Brazil just a week ago.<br><br>

    Business organisations int America were angered by Donald Trump's decision to expand the scope of restrictions on immigrant visas for workers. Mr trump claims this will protect American jobs. But the head of the US Chamber of Commerce, Thomas Donohue, warned that the measures will reduce job creation.<br><br>

    GVS, an Italian maker of personal equipment to protect against biohazards, went public on the Milan stock exchange, in Europe's second biggest IPO of the year so far.<br><br>

    SoftBank sold most of its stake in T-Mobile. The Japanese conglomerate raised almost $20bn by selling shares on the stockmarket and it a private tender, a signal to investors that it still has financial clout following some disastrous investments that left it with an $8.8bn annual loss. Meanwhile, Son Masayoshi, SoftBank's chief executive, stepped down from the board of Alibaba, bringing an end to the firms' close relationship.<br><br>

    The British government confirmed that pubs, restaurants and other services such as hairdressers will be allowed to reopen in England on July 4th. Britain has lagged behind France, Italy and other European countries in easing restrictions. Hotels have seen a surge in bookings for July and beyond, but if infections rise again it will be a short-lived break for holiday-makers.<br><br>

    Perhaps those looking to get away from it all could look to space. Virgin Galactic signed a deal with NASA this week to prepare a plan for taking feepaying passengers to the International Space Station. That may take some time; the company has yet to take space tourists on its less arduous suborbital flights.<br><br>

    The pandemic has stranded many workers at home, and also sent millions to the unemployment line. But that has meant tech giants have done well as home offices are kitted out with equipment and people communicate remotely. The soaring stock of those companies, and others, has increased the wealth of their bosses and, as a consequence, America has gained nearly 30 new billionaires since March, according to the Institute for Policy Studies, a left-leaning think-tank. The top five are thought to be 26% richer collectively than before covid-19.<br><br>

  <a></a><a></a><a></a><a></a><a><h2>[The new world disorder - June 20th-26th 2020]</h2></a>

  <p>
    <h3>The world this week - Politics</h3>

    Brazil reported a record 35,000 new cases of covid-10 in a day. Even that grim figure is widely regarded as an undercount. India is now recording tens of thousands of new infections each week. In america, Florida, Texas and Arizona set daily records for new cases. Although many places are easing lockdowns, Anthony Fauci, the leading adviser to the White House on infectious diseases, warned that the pandemic is far from over: "The numbers speak for themselves."<br><br>

    <b>Beijing</b> went into "wartime mode" to battle an outbreak of covid-19, the first in the Chinese capital after eight weeks with no cases reported of local transmission. Many of the cases are linked to a wholesale food market.<br><br>

    A court in <b>China</b> sentenced the country's former insurance regulator, Xiang Junbo, to 11 years in prison for accepting 18m yuan ($2.5m) in bribes. Mr Xiang had also served as deputy governor of the central bank.<br><br>

    At lease 20 <b>Indian</b> troops were killed in a fight with <b>Chinese</b> soldiers in the Galwan valley, the first combat deaths on the disputed Sino-Indian border in 45 years. China did not say how many of its soldiers died. The brawl involved nail-studded clubs and stones rather than guns. Tensions have increased since April, when the Chinese army encroached on Indian-claimed territory.<br><br>

    <b>North Korea</b> blew up the building used for meetings between its officials and those from <b>South Korea</b>. It said the explosion was retaliation for unflattering leaflets about its supreme leader, sent over the border via balloons by defectors, whom North Korea called "rubbish-like mongrel dogs".<br><br>

    A court in the <b>Philippines</b> found Maria Ressa Guilty of libel for alleging links between a businessman and a judge. Ms Ressa is the boss of Rappler, a news website that is critical of the country's strongman president, Rodrigo Duterte. Her lawyer said the message to other journalists was "Keep quiet, or you'll be nest."<br><br>

    Steven Mnuchin, America's treasury secretary, said his government will nominate Mauricio Claver-Carone, a staff member of Donald Trump's National Security Council, to lead the <b>Inter-American Development Bank</b>. All the bank's four presidents since its founding in 1959 have been from Latin America. The US has 30% of the bank's shares, the largest stake of any country.<br><br>

    <b>Venezuela's</b> Supreme Court removed the leaders of two opposition parties, Justice First and Democratic Action. It replaced them with men whom the parties had previously expelled for being stooges of Nicolas Maduro, the country's dictator.<br><br>

    America's Supreme Court ruled that the 1064 Civil Rights Act makes it illegal to fire workers for being <b>gay or transgender</b>. More than half the states allowed such discrimination. The 6-3 majority decision was written by Neil Gorsuch, a Trump appointee.<br><br>

    The White House tried to stop publication of a book by <b>John Bolton</b>, a former national security adviser, claiming that it contained classified information. The book says that Donald Trump tried to persuade Xi Jinping, China's president, to buy American farm goods to help his re-election campaign. It also alleges that in a meeting with Mr Xi, Mr Trump said he approved of China's policy of putting Uighur Muslims in internment camps. On June 17th Mr Trump signed a bill that imposes sanctions on Chinese officials who were  responsible for the Uighurs' internment.<br><br>

    A white policeman in <b>Atlanta</b> who shot dead a black man when he took the officer's Taser weapon was charged with murder. Republicans in the Senate unveiled their own set of police reforms. These are less radical than those put forward by Democrats but support the creation of a database to track police officers with a record of misconduct.<br><br>

    Boris Johnson, Britain's prime minister, announced that Britain's Department for International Development would be folded back into the Foreign Office. British aid will now focus less on ending poverty and more on advancing British foreign-policy goals.<br><br>

    Yousef al-Otaiba, a diplomat from the <b>United Arab Emirates</b>, wrote in an <b>Israeli</b> newspaper that any unilateral annexation of West Bank territory would harm Israel's relations with Arab countries. It is thought to be the first-ever opinion piece written by an official from the Gulf for an Israeli newspaper.<br><br>

    America imposed new sanctions on <b>Syria</b> that target any person, company or institution--Syrian or foreign--that does business with or provides support to tthe regime of President Bashar al-Assad.<br><br>

    There were more demonstrations in <b>Lebanon</b>. The government began injecting more American dollars into the market in an effort to support the local currency. Early talks with the IMF over a bail-out package have been shaken by concerns that the government is not serious about reform.<br><br>

    A judge overseeing a corruption trial in the <b>Democratic Republic of Congo</b> was murdered. Police initially said that the judge had had a heart attack, but an autopsy showed he had died from brain injuries after being stabbed in the head.<br><br>

    <h3>The world this week - Business</h3>

    The <b>Federal Reserve</b> clarified its new bond-buying strategy, announcing that it would acquire individual corporate bonds on the secondary market. This comes on top of its purchases in exchange-traded funds, which include some junk-rated funds that track debt. But the central bank's latest move comes almost three months after it first announced emergency measures to shore up markets. Questions have been raised about the length of time it has taken to roll out some of its programmes.<br><br>

    <b>Stockmarkets</b> rallied in response to the news from  the Fed, making up for some of the heavy losses they racked up in the  week ending June 12th, which was the worst for the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average since mid-March.<br><br>

    The Trump administration said it would let American tech firms work with Huawei on creating international standards for 5G. The decision represents a long-expected easing of the sanctions placed on the Chinese provider of telecoms networks and equipment over national-security concerns. America did not have much choice. Huawei's size and expertise makes  it one of the companies integral to setting the rules on international networks.<br><br>

    America's Justice Department put forward proposals that roll back the immunity of <b>social-media firms</b> for content posted on their platforms. Donald Trump signed an executive order recently rescinding  the protections after he got into a spat with Twitter, but it is unlikely to be upheld once it is challenged in court.<br><br>

    Robert Lighthizer, the US trade representative, confirmed that America had pulled out of talks with the EU that had sought to find common ground on <b>taxing  tech companies</b>. America argues that such levies will disproportionately hit its global giants, such as Apple and Google, and has threatened to retalizte with sanctions if European countries impose their own digital tax.<br><br>

    Facebook launched a payment service on its WhatsApp platform in Brazil. Brazilians can link their credit or debit cards to <b>WhatsApp Pay</b> to send money to each other or buy goods from small firms. Facebook had hoped India would be the first country to use the facility nationwide, but became bogged down in regulatory objections there.<br><br>

    <b>Retail sales</b> in America surged last month by 17.7% over April, more than double the amount that had been expected. That followed a 14.7% decline in April. Sales were still down by 6.1% compared with May last year. It is thought that the government's stimulus measures to households helped fuel the shopping spree, and that consumers might not spend so much when the money runs out.<br><br>

    In America's biggest IPO so far this year, Royalty Pharma raised $2.2bn when it listed on the Nasdaq exchange. The company invests in the rights to royalties on future drug sales across the life sciences, combining scientific expertise with capital investment for the industry. Royalty's share price leapt by more than half on the first day of trading.<br><br>

    Acknowledging  that demand for energy will remain weak in the aftermath of covid-19 and that governments "will accelerate the pace of transition to a lower carbon economy", <b>BP</b> said it would write  down the value of its oil and gas assets in the second quarter by between $13bn and $17.5bn. To buttress its balance-sheet the energy giant reportedly raised $12bn through a sale of hybrid bonds.<br><br>

    In its first forecast for 2021, the International Energy Agency said that <b>demand for oil</b> would increase by 5.7m barrels a day next year to 97.4m. That is still below the average for 2019, mostly because the aviation industry will still struggle in 2021. However, China's "strong exit from lockdown" saw its demand for oil in April rebound back almost to the level it was at a year ago.<br><br>

    In a rare admission of corporate wrongdoing on homicide-related charges, <b>PG&E</b> pleaded guilty to 84 counts of involuntary manslaughter in relation to the Camp Fire disaster in California two years ago. The electric utility's faulty equipment sparked the  inferno. Its chief executive (who was not in charge at the time of the fire) pled guilty to each one of the deaths of the 84 victims or the fire as their names were read out alphabetically. The company is soon to exit bankruptcy protections.<br><br>

    <b>Hertz</b> postponed a sale of new shares after the Securities and Exchange Commission raised objections. A judge had earlier allowed the sale to proceed, an unprecedented ruling for a company that has filed for bankruptcy protection. The car-hire company had warned potential buyers of the stock that they strand to lose their shirts unless there is a significant and "currently unanticipated improvement" in its business, which has been hammered by the pandemic.<br><br>

    게임질병? 우리가 언제까지나 게임을 즐겨도 괜찮은 이유</a>

    <p>
      독일의 유명한 극작가, 베르톨트 브레히트는 이런 유명한 말을 남겼습니다.
      "인간은 예술을 통해 삶을 즐기고, 즐거움은 삶의 의지를 강화시킨다."
      여러분이 게임과 같은 문화예술을 통해 삶이 더 즐거워지고
      그 즐거움 덕분 하루하루를 더 살아갈 의지가 생겨난다면
      이 즐거움으로 내일 하루가 더욱 기다려지게 된다면
      당신에게 있어 게임은 더 이상 시간낭비가 아닙니다.
      꼭 반드시 의미가 있거나 교훈을 주는 게임이 아니어도 좋습니다.
      내일은 얼마나 실력이 올랐을까 기대가 된다면
      내일은 어떤 아이템을 얻게 될까 설렌다면
      내일은 어떤 경험과 어떤 모험을 하게 될지 그 생각만으로 행복해진다면
      도저히 이 기대작들을 해보기 전까지 죽을 수 없다면
      당신에게 있어 게임은 더 이상 해악 질병도 아닙니다.
      내 삶까지 내팽개치면서 중독적으로 즐기는 게임이 아니라
      게임을 자신의 삶을 더욱 충실하게 만들어줄 윤활제로 사용한다면
      게임은 이미 여러분의 삶을 더욱 재밌고 내일을 기대하게 만드는
      재미 그 자체만으로도 가치가 있는
      훌륭한 문화예술이 되어있을테니까요.
      재미를 느끼는데 죄의식을 느낄 필요는 없습니다.
      재미는 인간됨의 핵심이고
      재미를 주는 게임은 인간의 발전에 너무나도 중요하기 때문입니다.
      게임을 통해, 더욱 재밌는 삶을 사세요.
      게임을 통해, 더욱 행복해지세요.
      그것이야말로, 게임이 주는 재미의 진정한 가치이고
      그것이야말로, 게임의 존재의의이며
      내가, 그리고 우리가 게이머의 삶을 선택한 이유이기 때문입니다.<br>

      사람들이 코지마를 천재, 혹은 감독이라고 칭하는 이유는
      그가 단순히 게임만 잘 만들어서가 아닙니다.
      그저 게임을 잘 만드는 것을 넘어
      주제 의식을 게임의 플레이와 연출에 '밀접하게' 결합하기 때문입니다.
      영화감독들이 컷 하나하나에 자신의 의도를 담아내듯
      코지마는 게임 속 플레이와 연출에 자신의 의도와 메시지를 담아낸단 말이죠.
      일례로 그는 메탈기어 시리즈 하나에서도
      '디지털 시대에 진실이란 구분될 수 있는가'
      '무엇이 사람의 운명을 결정하고 세대를 잇게 하는가' 등
      무게감 있는 메시지를 게임 속 각종 장치들과 연결해 보여줬습니다.
      일각에서는 그의 이런 성향 때문에
      게임을 플레이하는 것보다 '보고 듣는게' 더 많다고 불평하기도 합니다.
      하지만 이런 이들도 코지마가 연출을 통해 전하려는 감정이
      플레이 없인 제대로 느낄 수 없는
      '게임의 일부'라는 것은 부정할 수 없을 것입니다.
      이런 작품관 덕에 코지마 감독은 단단한 마니아층을 가진 몇 안되는 개발자이자
      영화계 인사들에게 많이 알려져 있고 또 극찬 받는 개발자가 됐습니다.

      * 게임 중독에 대한 유명한 질답<br>
      엄마: 아들이 게임 중독이라 걱정입니다.
      어느 날 아들이 제 카드에 100만원이 넘는 돈을 몰래 과금했는데
      남편에게 말해 혼내봐도 아이는 자기가 큰 돈을 마음대로 쓴 건 잘못한 거지만
      친구들에게 잘 보이려 정말 그 아이템이 없으면 안되는 거라고
      엄마 아빠가 그런 거 하나 못해주냐 도리어 역정을 내는 거 있죠.
      아이가 게임에 미쳐 제정신이 아닌 것 같습니다.<br>
      답변: 질문자님의 아이는 게임에 미 100만원을 쓴 바보나 중독자가 아니라
      100만원을 쓰지 않고는 자신이 얼마나 귀한 존재인지를
      좀처럼 실감할 수 없었던 슬픈 소년입니다.
      질문자님의 관심이 향해야 할 곳은 질문자님의 게임중독자 아이가 아니라
      이 세상에서 내가 귀한 것을 누가 좀 알아달라고
      목놓아 외치고 있는 바로 그 슬픈 소년일 것입니다.

    <p>
      지난 10년 간을 한 번 생각해 보세요.
      어떤 게임들이 진정으로 유니크했고, 독립적이었고, 위험을 무릅썼으며
      어떤 게임들이 인디게임 영화에 소개될 만 했는지
      그들은 대체로 재정적 위험을 가지고 있었습니다.
      인디가 무엇이냐고 물을 때, 바로 그런 것들이 제가 찾는 것입니다.
      지난 몇 년간 사람들이 말해온 인디 스타는
      그들은 정말로 믿지만, 아무도 믿지 않았던 것들을 시도한 사람들입니다.
      그리고 그 게임들은 성공적이었어요.
      그런 게 바로 우리가 듣고 싶어하는 스토리죠.
      그런 이야기엔 어떤 낭만 같은 게 있어요.
      그래서 전 말해왔죠.
      내 마음 속 인디는 해적선이다.
      룰을 따르지 않고 보물을 찾는 그런 해적선이요.
      바다는 열려있고, 위험하고, 그들 중 많은 사람이 죽겠지만,
      때때로 어느 해적은 보물을 찾고
      다른 해적들이 속도를 내 계속 달리게 하죠.
      그게 바로 인디 정신이에요.
      최소한 제가 생각하는 인디란 그런 것이에요.
      저는 해적선을 보고 싶어요.
      모두가 바다에 둥둥 떠 있는 모습은 보고 싶지 않아요.
