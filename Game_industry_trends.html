    Shell joined the list of big oil and gas companies that have had to write down the value of assets because of falling energy demand and lower oil prices. The company expects to record charges of between $15bn and $22bn in the second quarter related to the writedowns. BP, meanwhile, agreed to sell what is left of its petrochemicals business to Ineos, a privately held firm with a record of taking over the chemical divisions of multinational companies, for $5bn.<br><br>

    Germany became the latest flashpoint for safely concerns at Amazon warehouses during the pandemic, as its workers went on strike. Their union claims that 40 people contracted covid-19 at two sites recently. The online retailer says it has provided enough personal protective equipment.<br><br>

    Meanwhile, Amazon sealed a deal to buy Zoox, a developer of self-driving taxis. Reportedly costing $1.2bn, it is Amazon's biggest investment in autonomous-vehicle technology, which it may try to adapt for its delivery services.<br><br>

    Wells Fargo became the first big American bank to cut its dividend in light of the Federal Reserve's recent stress tests. The central bank banned share buy-back programmes and capped dividends for 33 banks during the third quarter. All large banks will be required to resubmit and update their capital plans later this year to show they can cope with and extreme economic scenario.<br><br>

    Cirque du Soleil filed for bankruptcy protection and laid off 3,500 employees who had been furloughed in March, when it was forced to cancel performances because of covid-19. In other pandemic related redundancies, SSP Group, which operates food outlets at transport hubs around the world, and is best known in Britain, its home market, for its Upper Crust and Camden Food Co shops, slashed 5,000 jobs. Microsoft announced the permanent closure of all its 83 stores, most of which are in America.<br><br>

    American stockmarkets recorded their best quarter in at least two decades. From April to June the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average rose by around 25%, and the Nasdaq by over a third. Most of the gains came in April and May following the market rout in March amid the coronavirus crisis(European stocks actually outperformed the S&P 500 in June). Most share indices are still lower than at the start of the year. The tech-heavy Nasdaq is a notable exception; it has climbed by 10%.<br><br>

    Tesla overtook Toyota to become the world's biggest carmaker by market capitalisation. The maker of electric vehicles has seen its share price rev up from $225 a year ago to $1,120, giving it a value of more than $205bn. It has yet to turn an annual profit.<br><br>

    In China, Byton, a startup with ambitions to compete against Tesla, suspended production and sent its staff home. Sales of electric and hybrid vehicles have fallen drastically in China following the end of government tax breaks. Byton is one of several Chinese EV startups that investors piled into hoping for rich returns, though it has not delivered a single vehicle.<br><br>

    Mirror, a home-workout business, was snapped up by LuLulemon, a maker of snazzy yoga pants, for $500m. Mirror makes body-length wall mounted smart screens through which exercisers can interact online with buff personal trainers live or on-demand. The pandemic has been a boon for the high-end fitness industry. But once gyms reopen it remains to be seen whether people will still splash out $1,500 for one of Mirror's screens, or just plod and puff on a treadmill.<br><br>

    <h3>The world this week - Politics</h3>

    Some states in the south and west of the United States recorded their biggest daily rise in cases of covid-19, bringing America's total to over 2.3m. The governor of Texas, Greg Abbott, urged people to stay indoors. He also declared that the state remained "wide open for business". California recorded new highs in hospital admissions. Connecticut, New Jersey and New York are to quarantine visitors  from states that are covid hotspots.<br><br>

    Donald Trump sacked Geoffrey Berman as the federal prosecutor for Manhattan. Mr Berman's office had successfully prosecuted Mr Trump's former lawyer (Br Berman was recused from the case) and is investigating his current one, Rudy Giuliani.<br><br>

    Less than a month after the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, an attempt to reform police procedures in Minnesota came to naught when Democrats and Republicans failed to reach a compromise in the state legislature.<br><br>

    Suriname's president, Desi Bouterse, who has dominated the country's politics for more than 40 years, conceded defeat in an election held on May 25th. His likely successor is Chan Santokhi, of the mainly Indo-Surinamese Progressive Reform Party. In November a military court found Mr Bouterse guilty of murdering 15 political opponents in 1982.<br><br>

    Brazilian police arrested a former aide to Flavio Bolsonaro, the eldest son of the president, Jair Bolsonaro, in  an investigation into corruption. Flavio, a senator, is himself being investigated for possible involvement in the scheme when he was a state deputy in Rio de Janeiro.<br><br>

    Brazil's education minister, Abraham Weintraub, resigned after the Supreme Court included him in an inquiry of a criminal scheme to spread slurs and threats directed at its judges. Mr Weintraub had described the judges as "bums" who should be  jailed. He has flown to America.<br><br>

    Singapore called an early election on July 10th. Lee Hsien Loong, the prime minister, has said he will step down during the next parliamentary term. Negative campaigning is effectively banned, which makes it hard for the opposition.<br><br>

    Almazbek Atambayev, a former president of Kyrgyzstan, was sentenced to prison for 11 years for illegally releasing a crime boss, who subsequently fled to Russia. Mr Atambayev was arrested in August after throngs of soldiers and police stormed his compound.<br><br>

    India expelled half the staff at Pakistan's embassy in Delhi, accusing them of spying and working for terrorists. Pakistan's foreign ministry said it had responded in kind, telling half the diplomats at India's embassy in Islamabad to leave.<br><br>

    After blowing up their joint liaison office, North Korea tried to de-escalate tensions with South Korea by saying it would not take any further action. The North had threatened to deploy troops in the demilitarised zone between the two countries to punish the South for letting activists send pamphlets critical of Kim Jong Un, the North's despot, over the border by balloon.<br><br>

    America named four more Chinese media organisations operating in the United States as government foreign missions. The State Department said the four--CCTV, China News Service, the People's Daily and Global Times--produced propaganda for the Chinese Communist Party.<br><br>

    The installation of china's Beidou navigation system was completed with the placing in orbit of its final satellite. Beidou, a rival to America's GPS, has taken two decades to build.<br><br>

    China charged two Canadians with spying, more than 18 months after they were arrested. China is widely thought to be keeping the men in custody in response to Canada's detention of a senior executive of Huawei following an extradition request from America.<br><br>

    Police in Tanzania arrested Zitto Kabwe, an opposition leader. He was charged with "endangering the peace" after meeting supporters. To prepare for an election in October the government has arrested journalists, closed newspapers and harassed dissidents.<br><br>

    Malawians voted in a re-run of a presidential election after courts overturned the results of a rigged one supposedly won last year by the incumbent, Peter Mutharika. Electoral officials have eight days to release the count.<br><br>

    A suicide-bomber killed two people in an attack on a Turkish military base in Somalia that was claimed by al-Shabab, a jihadist group. Turkey is helping to train Somali soldiers.<br><br>

    Egypt's president, Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi, threatened to intervene in neighbouring Libya if Turkish-backed militias captured Sirte, a strategic port, from Khalifa Haftar, a rebellious general who is also backed by Russia. The militias have been moving towards General Haftar's heartland in the east.<br><br>

    Prosecutors from a court in The Hague said they were charging Hashim Thaci, the president of Kosovo, with war crimes, murder and torture relating to the period during and immediately after the war there in 1999. Mr Thaci had been about to attend a summit at the White House, but cancelled his visit.<br><br>

    <h3>The world this week - Business</h3>

    The IMF drastically reduced its outlook for the world economy, projecting that it will contract by 4.9% this year. The downward revision was across the board; all regions will suffer shrinkage. America's GDP is now expected to fall by 8%, Britain's and the euro area's both by 10.2% and Japan's by 5.8% Most emerging markets will fare little better. China, though, is forecast to grow by 1%.<br><br>

    Andrew Bailey, the governor of the Bank of England, said that he  doesn't want its bond-buying programme to become a "permanent feature" of the British economy. In a shift of policy from his  predecessor, Mark Carney, Mr Bailey indicated that it "would be better to consider adjusting the level of reserves first" before raising interest rates. The central bank recently increased its quantitative-easing programme by $125bn.<br><br>

    The pentagon released a list of 20 companies and  state-controlled enterprises it believes are owned or supported  by the Chinese army. The publication of the list, which includes Huawei, is mostly symbolic. Congress required the Pentagon to catalogue entities with ties to China's armed forces in 1999, but no document had ever been made public before.<br><br>

    Wirecard, a German digital payments company, filed for insolvency after Markus Braun, its chief executive, was arrested to answer allegations of fraud. The company has admitted that $2.1bn held on its balance-sheet probably does not exist. In what is one of Europe's biggest accounting scandals in recent years, Wirecard acknowledged the money was phantom after two banks in the Philippines where it supposedly had been deposited denied having ever received it.<br><br>

    Bayer agreed to pay up to $10.9bn to settle claims that its Roundup weedkiller causes cancer. The German drugs and chemicals company inherited the claims when it bought Monsanto, Roundup's maker, in 2018. It might have to make further payouts to those plaintiffs who are refusing to settle.<br><br>

    Apple said it would start offering desktop and laptop computers powered by chips designed in-house, rather than those from Intel, its current supplier. The chips, derived from designs by ARM, which is based in Britain, will be similar to those that already power its smartphones and tablets. Apple hopes that the ability to run software across multiple devices might boost sales of its Mac computers.<br><br>

    Brazil's central bank blocked Facebook's digital-payments service on WhatsApp because it had yet to complete its analysis of the implications. WhatsApp Pay was launched in Brazil just a week ago.<br><br>

    Business organisations int America were angered by Donald Trump's decision to expand the scope of restrictions on immigrant visas for workers. Mr trump claims this will protect American jobs. But the head of the US Chamber of Commerce, Thomas Donohue, warned that the measures will reduce job creation.<br><br>

    GVS, an Italian maker of personal equipment to protect against biohazards, went public on the Milan stock exchange, in Europe's second biggest IPO of the year so far.<br><br>

    SoftBank sold most of its stake in T-Mobile. The Japanese conglomerate raised almost $20bn by selling shares on the stockmarket and it a private tender, a signal to investors that it still has financial clout following some disastrous investments that left it with an $8.8bn annual loss. Meanwhile, Son Masayoshi, SoftBank's chief executive, stepped down from the board of Alibaba, bringing an end to the firms' close relationship.<br><br>

    The British government confirmed that pubs, restaurants and other services such as hairdressers will be allowed to reopen in England on July 4th. Britain has lagged behind France, Italy and other European countries in easing restrictions. Hotels have seen a surge in bookings for July and beyond, but if infections rise again it will be a short-lived break for holiday-makers.<br><br>

    Perhaps those looking to get away from it all could look to space. Virgin Galactic signed a deal with NASA this week to prepare a plan for taking feepaying passengers to the International Space Station. That may take some time; the company has yet to take space tourists on its less arduous suborbital flights.<br><br>

    The pandemic has stranded many workers at home, and also sent millions to the unemployment line. But that has meant tech giants have done well as home offices are kitted out with equipment and people communicate remotely. The soaring stock of those companies, and others, has increased the wealth of their bosses and, as a consequence, America has gained nearly 30 new billionaires since March, according to the Institute for Policy Studies, a left-leaning think-tank. The top five are thought to be 26% richer collectively than before covid-19.<br><br>

  <p>
    <h3>The world this week - Politics</h3>

    Brazil reported a record 35,000 new cases of covid-10 in a day. Even that grim figure is widely regarded as an undercount. India is now recording tens of thousands of new infections each week. In america, Florida, Texas and Arizona set daily records for new cases. Although many places are easing lockdowns, Anthony Fauci, the leading adviser to the White House on infectious diseases, warned that the pandemic is far from over: "The numbers speak for themselves."<br><br>

    <b>Beijing</b> went into "wartime mode" to battle an outbreak of covid-19, the first in the Chinese capital after eight weeks with no cases reported of local transmission. Many of the cases are linked to a wholesale food market.<br><br>

    A court in <b>China</b> sentenced the country's former insurance regulator, Xiang Junbo, to 11 years in prison for accepting 18m yuan ($2.5m) in bribes. Mr Xiang had also served as deputy governor of the central bank.<br><br>

    At lease 20 <b>Indian</b> troops were killed in a fight with <b>Chinese</b> soldiers in the Galwan valley, the first combat deaths on the disputed Sino-Indian border in 45 years. China did not say how many of its soldiers died. The brawl involved nail-studded clubs and stones rather than guns. Tensions have increased since April, when the Chinese army encroached on Indian-claimed territory.<br><br>

    <b>North Korea</b> blew up the building used for meetings between its officials and those from <b>South Korea</b>. It said the explosion was retaliation for unflattering leaflets about its supreme leader, sent over the border via balloons by defectors, whom North Korea called "rubbish-like mongrel dogs".<br><br>

    A court in the <b>Philippines</b> found Maria Ressa Guilty of libel for alleging links between a businessman and a judge. Ms Ressa is the boss of Rappler, a news website that is critical of the country's strongman president, Rodrigo Duterte. Her lawyer said the message to other journalists was "Keep quiet, or you'll be nest."<br><br>

    Steven Mnuchin, America's treasury secretary, said his government will nominate Mauricio Claver-Carone, a staff member of Donald Trump's National Security Council, to lead the <b>Inter-American Development Bank</b>. All the bank's four presidents since its founding in 1959 have been from Latin America. The US has 30% of the bank's shares, the largest stake of any country.<br><br>

    <b>Venezuela's</b> Supreme Court removed the leaders of two opposition parties, Justice First and Democratic Action. It replaced them with men whom the parties had previously expelled for being stooges of Nicolas Maduro, the country's dictator.<br><br>

    America's Supreme Court ruled that the 1064 Civil Rights Act makes it illegal to fire workers for being <b>gay or transgender</b>. More than half the states allowed such discrimination. The 6-3 majority decision was written by Neil Gorsuch, a Trump appointee.<br><br>

    The White House tried to stop publication of a book by <b>John Bolton</b>, a former national security adviser, claiming that it contained classified information. The book says that Donald Trump tried to persuade Xi Jinping, China's president, to buy American farm goods to help his re-election campaign. It also alleges that in a meeting with Mr Xi, Mr Trump said he approved of China's policy of putting Uighur Muslims in internment camps. On June 17th Mr Trump signed a bill that imposes sanctions on Chinese officials who were  responsible for the Uighurs' internment.<br><br>

    A white policeman in <b>Atlanta</b> who shot dead a black man when he took the officer's Taser weapon was charged with murder. Republicans in the Senate unveiled their own set of police reforms. These are less radical than those put forward by Democrats but support the creation of a database to track police officers with a record of misconduct.<br><br>

    Boris Johnson, Britain's prime minister, announced that Britain's Department for International Development would be folded back into the Foreign Office. British aid will now focus less on ending poverty and more on advancing British foreign-policy goals.<br><br>

    Yousef al-Otaiba, a diplomat from the <b>United Arab Emirates</b>, wrote in an <b>Israeli</b> newspaper that any unilateral annexation of West Bank territory would harm Israel's relations with Arab countries. It is thought to be the first-ever opinion piece written by an official from the Gulf for an Israeli newspaper.<br><br>

    America imposed new sanctions on <b>Syria</b> that target any person, company or institution--Syrian or foreign--that does business with or provides support to tthe regime of President Bashar al-Assad.<br><br>

    There were more demonstrations in <b>Lebanon</b>. The government began injecting more American dollars into the market in an effort to support the local currency. Early talks with the IMF over a bail-out package have been shaken by concerns that the government is not serious about reform.<br><br>

    A judge overseeing a corruption trial in the <b>Democratic Republic of Congo</b> was murdered. Police initially said that the judge had had a heart attack, but an autopsy showed he had died from brain injuries after being stabbed in the head.<br><br>

    <h3>The world this week - Business</h3>

    The <b>Federal Reserve</b> clarified its new bond-buying strategy, announcing that it would acquire individual corporate bonds on the secondary market. This comes on top of its purchases in exchange-traded funds, which include some junk-rated funds that track debt. But the central bank's latest move comes almost three months after it first announced emergency measures to shore up markets. Questions have been raised about the length of time it has taken to roll out some of its programmes.<br><br>

    <b>Stockmarkets</b> rallied in response to the news from  the Fed, making up for some of the heavy losses they racked up in the  week ending June 12th, which was the worst for the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average since mid-March.<br><br>

    The Trump administration said it would let American tech firms work with Huawei on creating international standards for 5G. The decision represents a long-expected easing of the sanctions placed on the Chinese provider of telecoms networks and equipment over national-security concerns. America did not have much choice. Huawei's size and expertise makes  it one of the companies integral to setting the rules on international networks.<br><br>

    America's Justice Department put forward proposals that roll back the immunity of <b>social-media firms</b> for content posted on their platforms. Donald Trump signed an executive order recently rescinding  the protections after he got into a spat with Twitter, but it is unlikely to be upheld once it is challenged in court.<br><br>

    Robert Lighthizer, the US trade representative, confirmed that America had pulled out of talks with the EU that had sought to find common ground on <b>taxing  tech companies</b>. America argues that such levies will disproportionately hit its global giants, such as Apple and Google, and has threatened to retalizte with sanctions if European countries impose their own digital tax.<br><br>

    Facebook launched a payment service on its WhatsApp platform in Brazil. Brazilians can link their credit or debit cards to <b>WhatsApp Pay</b> to send money to each other or buy goods from small firms. Facebook had hoped India would be the first country to use the facility nationwide, but became bogged down in regulatory objections there.<br><br>

    <b>Retail sales</b> in America surged last month by 17.7% over April, more than double the amount that had been expected. That followed a 14.7% decline in April. Sales were still down by 6.1% compared with May last year. It is thought that the government's stimulus measures to households helped fuel the shopping spree, and that consumers might not spend so much when the money runs out.<br><br>

    In America's biggest IPO so far this year, Royalty Pharma raised $2.2bn when it listed on the Nasdaq exchange. The company invests in the rights to royalties on future drug sales across the life sciences, combining scientific expertise with capital investment for the industry. Royalty's share price leapt by more than half on the first day of trading.<br><br>

    Acknowledging  that demand for energy will remain weak in the aftermath of covid-19 and that governments "will accelerate the pace of transition to a lower carbon economy", <b>BP</b> said it would write  down the value of its oil and gas assets in the second quarter by between $13bn and $17.5bn. To buttress its balance-sheet the energy giant reportedly raised $12bn through a sale of hybrid bonds.<br><br>

    In its first forecast for 2021, the International Energy Agency said that <b>demand for oil</b> would increase by 5.7m barrels a day next year to 97.4m. That is still below the average for 2019, mostly because the aviation industry will still struggle in 2021. However, China's "strong exit from lockdown" saw its demand for oil in April rebound back almost to the level it was at a year ago.<br><br>

    In a rare admission of corporate wrongdoing on homicide-related charges, <b>PG&E</b> pleaded guilty to 84 counts of involuntary manslaughter in relation to the Camp Fire disaster in California two years ago. The electric utility's faulty equipment sparked the  inferno. Its chief executive (who was not in charge at the time of the fire) pled guilty to each one of the deaths of the 84 victims or the fire as their names were read out alphabetically. The company is soon to exit bankruptcy protections.<br><br>

    <b>Hertz</b> postponed a sale of new shares after the Securities and Exchange Commission raised objections. A judge had earlier allowed the sale to proceed, an unprecedented ruling for a company that has filed for bankruptcy protection. The car-hire company had warned potential buyers of the stock that they strand to lose their shirts unless there is a significant and "currently unanticipated improvement" in its business, which has been hammered by the pandemic.<br><br>

    게임질병? 우리가 언제까지나 게임을 즐겨도 괜찮은 이유</a>

    <p>
      독일의 유명한 극작가, 베르톨트 브레히트는 이런 유명한 말을 남겼습니다.
      "인간은 예술을 통해 삶을 즐기고, 즐거움은 삶의 의지를 강화시킨다."
      여러분이 게임과 같은 문화예술을 통해 삶이 더 즐거워지고
      그 즐거움 덕분 하루하루를 더 살아갈 의지가 생겨난다면
      이 즐거움으로 내일 하루가 더욱 기다려지게 된다면
      당신에게 있어 게임은 더 이상 시간낭비가 아닙니다.
      꼭 반드시 의미가 있거나 교훈을 주는 게임이 아니어도 좋습니다.
      내일은 얼마나 실력이 올랐을까 기대가 된다면
      내일은 어떤 아이템을 얻게 될까 설렌다면
      내일은 어떤 경험과 어떤 모험을 하게 될지 그 생각만으로 행복해진다면
      도저히 이 기대작들을 해보기 전까지 죽을 수 없다면
      당신에게 있어 게임은 더 이상 해악 질병도 아닙니다.
      내 삶까지 내팽개치면서 중독적으로 즐기는 게임이 아니라
      게임을 자신의 삶을 더욱 충실하게 만들어줄 윤활제로 사용한다면
      게임은 이미 여러분의 삶을 더욱 재밌고 내일을 기대하게 만드는
      재미 그 자체만으로도 가치가 있는
      훌륭한 문화예술이 되어있을테니까요.
      재미를 느끼는데 죄의식을 느낄 필요는 없습니다.
      재미는 인간됨의 핵심이고
      재미를 주는 게임은 인간의 발전에 너무나도 중요하기 때문입니다.
      게임을 통해, 더욱 재밌는 삶을 사세요.
      게임을 통해, 더욱 행복해지세요.
      그것이야말로, 게임이 주는 재미의 진정한 가치이고
      그것이야말로, 게임의 존재의의이며
      내가, 그리고 우리가 게이머의 삶을 선택한 이유이기 때문입니다.<br>

      사람들이 코지마를 천재, 혹은 감독이라고 칭하는 이유는
      그가 단순히 게임만 잘 만들어서가 아닙니다.
      그저 게임을 잘 만드는 것을 넘어
      주제 의식을 게임의 플레이와 연출에 '밀접하게' 결합하기 때문입니다.
      영화감독들이 컷 하나하나에 자신의 의도를 담아내듯
      코지마는 게임 속 플레이와 연출에 자신의 의도와 메시지를 담아낸단 말이죠.
      일례로 그는 메탈기어 시리즈 하나에서도
      '디지털 시대에 진실이란 구분될 수 있는가'
      '무엇이 사람의 운명을 결정하고 세대를 잇게 하는가' 등
      무게감 있는 메시지를 게임 속 각종 장치들과 연결해 보여줬습니다.
      일각에서는 그의 이런 성향 때문에
      게임을 플레이하는 것보다 '보고 듣는게' 더 많다고 불평하기도 합니다.
      하지만 이런 이들도 코지마가 연출을 통해 전하려는 감정이
      플레이 없인 제대로 느낄 수 없는
      '게임의 일부'라는 것은 부정할 수 없을 것입니다.
      이런 작품관 덕에 코지마 감독은 단단한 마니아층을 가진 몇 안되는 개발자이자
      영화계 인사들에게 많이 알려져 있고 또 극찬 받는 개발자가 됐습니다.

      * 게임 중독에 대한 유명한 질답<br>
      엄마: 아들이 게임 중독이라 걱정입니다.
      어느 날 아들이 제 카드에 100만원이 넘는 돈을 몰래 과금했는데
      남편에게 말해 혼내봐도 아이는 자기가 큰 돈을 마음대로 쓴 건 잘못한 거지만
      친구들에게 잘 보이려 정말 그 아이템이 없으면 안되는 거라고
      엄마 아빠가 그런 거 하나 못해주냐 도리어 역정을 내는 거 있죠.
      아이가 게임에 미쳐 제정신이 아닌 것 같습니다.<br>
      답변: 질문자님의 아이는 게임에 미 100만원을 쓴 바보나 중독자가 아니라
      100만원을 쓰지 않고는 자신이 얼마나 귀한 존재인지를
      좀처럼 실감할 수 없었던 슬픈 소년입니다.
      질문자님의 관심이 향해야 할 곳은 질문자님의 게임중독자 아이가 아니라
      이 세상에서 내가 귀한 것을 누가 좀 알아달라고
      목놓아 외치고 있는 바로 그 슬픈 소년일 것입니다.

    <p>
      지난 10년 간을 한 번 생각해 보세요.
      어떤 게임들이 진정으로 유니크했고, 독립적이었고, 위험을 무릅썼으며
      어떤 게임들이 인디게임 영화에 소개될 만 했는지
      그들은 대체로 재정적 위험을 가지고 있었습니다.
      인디가 무엇이냐고 물을 때, 바로 그런 것들이 제가 찾는 것입니다.
      지난 몇 년간 사람들이 말해온 인디 스타는
      그들은 정말로 믿지만, 아무도 믿지 않았던 것들을 시도한 사람들입니다.
      그리고 그 게임들은 성공적이었어요.
      그런 게 바로 우리가 듣고 싶어하는 스토리죠.
      그런 이야기엔 어떤 낭만 같은 게 있어요.
      그래서 전 말해왔죠.
      내 마음 속 인디는 해적선이다.
      룰을 따르지 않고 보물을 찾는 그런 해적선이요.
      바다는 열려있고, 위험하고, 그들 중 많은 사람이 죽겠지만,
      때때로 어느 해적은 보물을 찾고
      다른 해적들이 속도를 내 계속 달리게 하죠.
      그게 바로 인디 정신이에요.
      최소한 제가 생각하는 인디란 그런 것이에요.
      저는 해적선을 보고 싶어요.
      모두가 바다에 둥둥 떠 있는 모습은 보고 싶지 않아요.
